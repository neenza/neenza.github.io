Algorithm : 
Linear Search Algorithm:
1. Start at the first element of the array.
2. Repeat the following steps until you've checked all elements in the 
array:
• Compare the current element with the target value.
• If they are equal, return the current index as the result.
• If they are not equal, move to the next element in the array.
3. If you have checked all elements and haven't found the target value, 
return -1 to indicate that the target is not present in the array.
Binary Search Algorithm:
1. Define a left pointer as the index of the first element and a right 
pointer as the index of the last element in the array.
2. Repeat the following steps as long as the left pointer is less than or 
equal to the right pointer:
• Calculate the middle index between the left and right pointers.
• Compare the element at the middle index with the target value.
• If they are equal, return the middle index as the result.
• If the element at the middle index is less than the target value, 
update the left pointer to be one position to the right of the 
middle index.
• If the element at the middle index is greater than the target 
value, update the right pointer to be one position to the left of 
the middle index.
3. If the left pointer becomes greater than the right pointer, the search 
interval has been exhausted and the target is not present in the array.
4. Return -1 to indicate that the target is not found in the array.
